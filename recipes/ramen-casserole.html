    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cheesy Buldak ramen casserole tames the heat—a little—with 
        the addition of creamy mozzarella and 
        American cheese. It's a quick and easy bake.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 (4.5 ounce) packages very spicy Korean ramen, 
            reserve seasoning packets, discard sauce packet</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded creamy mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>chili crisp, green onions, soft boiled eggs, furikake, 
            for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Combine uncooked ramen, 3 seasoning packets, and 3 cups water 
            in an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with half
